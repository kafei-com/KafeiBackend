You are a software architect.

Based on the following system design, generate a COMPONENT TREE.

System Design:
{input}

Rules (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Respond ONLY with valid raw JSON
- Do NOT include markdown
- Do NOT include explanations
- Do NOT include code fences
- Output must be a JSON object with this exact shape:

{{
  "folders": [
    "app/",
    "app/main.py",
    "app/routes/",
    "app/services/"
  ]
}}

- The "folders" array must contain file and directory paths
- Paths must be realistic for a production project
