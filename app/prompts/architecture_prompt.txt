You are an expert system architect. Based on the following input, generate:
1. High-level architecture description
2. Mermaid component diagram
3. Mermaid sequence diagram
4. Folder structure
5. Tech stack
6. Deployment instructions
7. Risks & tradeoffs

Input:
{input}

Respond ONLY with valid raw JSON:
{{
  "architecture": "...",
  "diagram": "...",
  "structure": "...",
  "deployment": "...",
  "risks": "..."
}}

Do NOT include triple backticks or code fences.
Do NOT wrap JSON in ```json blocks.
Do NOT include mermaid inside backticks — output mermaid plain text only.

The `structure` field must be a JSON array of folder and file paths like:
"structure": [
  "app/",
  "app/main.py",
  "app/models/",
  "app/models/user.py"
]
